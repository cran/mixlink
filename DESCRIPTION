Description: The Mixture Link model <arXiv:1612.03302> is a proposed extension to generalized linear models, where the outcome distribution is a finite mixture of J > 1 densities. This package supports Mixture Link computations for Poisson and Binomial outcomes. This includes the distribution functions, numerical maximum likelihood estimation, Bayesian analysis, and quantile residuals to assess model fit.
